Goal:
Delete the red “X” button from the Group Selection toolbar and remove any behavior it triggers. The Exit Selection button remains the only way to end selection. The pencil/edit button must remain visible and functional while a selection exists.

Edits to make (apply to the whole repo):

Remove UI for the red X

In the Group Toolbar JSX (e.g., property-map.tsx, GroupToolbar.tsx, or similar):

Delete the <button> (or component) that renders the red close/dismiss action.

If actions are driven by an array/config, remove the entry with role/name "close" | "dismiss" | "clear".

Remove any conditional that inserts an X icon in group mode.

Remove imports / aliases of the X icon

From lucide-react, delete all X-type imports used by the toolbar: X, XCircle, XOctagon, Close, Times (any alias).

Delete any local IconX wrapper/component if it is only used for this button.

Disable the red X behavior everywhere

Find and delete any handler invoked by that button in group mode:

Examples: handleCloseGroupToolbar, onCloseGroup, hideEditPanel, setShowEditPanel(false), setShowEditTools(false).

Remove only the binding to the button; keep the generic functions if they’re used elsewhere.

Ensure no keyboard shortcut (e.g., Escape) calls those same handlers for group mode. Escape should not clear or exit selection unless it routes through Exit Selection.

Keep selection + pencil visible during selection

While selectedIds.length > 0 (or your equivalent), the pencil/edit control stays visible.

Do not change any selection state in this change set (do not call setSelectedIds([]) or exit mode).

Do not trigger map.setView, map.flyTo, or any zoom when showing/hiding the edit tools.

Style/layout cleanup

Remove any CSS/variants specifically styling the red X in the toolbar (e.g., .btn--danger, .toolbar__close used only for this).

Ensure spacing/alignment is correct after the button removal (no orphaned gaps).

Acceptance criteria (verify manually):

When multiple points are selected: toolbar shows Exit Selection and pencil/edit; no red X appears.

Clicking Exit Selection ends selection as before.

Clicking the pencil/edit still opens edit controls and applies formatting.

No action anywhere hides the pencil/edit without ending selection.

Selection is never cleared by any leftover “close/dismiss” code.

No zoom or pan occurs due to toolbar visibility changes.

Output to return:

List of files/lines changed (or a short diff).

Confirmation that “red X” is gone, no click/keyboard path triggers its old behavior, and selection + pencil work as specified.
