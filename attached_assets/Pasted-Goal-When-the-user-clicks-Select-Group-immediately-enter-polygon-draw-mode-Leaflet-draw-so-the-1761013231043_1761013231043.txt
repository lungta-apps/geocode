Goal
When the user clicks “Select Group”, immediately enter polygon draw mode (Leaflet-draw) so they can start drawing the selection right away. Remove the on-map toolbar and its buttons (polygon, circle, edit, trash). Keep “Exit Selection” as the way to leave selection mode. No zoom/pan changes. Works in original and expanded map states.

Implementation

Remove the on-map toolbar UI

Delete the rendered toolbar component and its buttons (polygon, circle, edit/pencil, trash) from the map.

If there’s a DrawingControl component that renders these buttons, remove its visible controls (or remove the component entirely if not needed).

Delete any related imports, CSS, and dead handlers that only served those buttons.

Auto-start polygon draw when selection mode turns on

In property-map.tsx (or the map component that owns Leaflet instance and selection logic):

When isSelectionMode becomes true (i.e., user clicked Select Group), programmatically enable the polygon tool:

// Pseudocode to implement:
// const map = mapRef.current;
// drawPolygonRef.current = new L.Draw.Polygon(map, { /* keep your existing style options */ });
// drawPolygonRef.current.enable();

Do not start circle mode and do not render any UI for it.

Handle polygon completion and selection callback

Keep (or add) the existing draw:created listener that:

Gets the polygon geometry,

Computes which properties fall inside,

Calls the existing onPropertySelection(geocodes: string[]) callback to update group selection.

After draw:created, do not auto-zoom or pan.

Cancel/exit behavior

“Exit Selection” should:

Disable any active drawing state (drawPolygonRef.current?.disable()),

Clear the temporary drawn shape only if that was the previous behavior,

Close group selection mode (setIsSelectionMode(false)), as it already does.

The Esc key may cancel the active draw sketch, but must not exit selection mode unless the app already does that intentionally.

Both map states

Ensure the same behavior (auto-start polygon, no toolbar) works in original and expanded map views. If there are two map instances/keys, apply the same logic in both.

No regressions

Keep all current color/highlight rules (selected icons + polygons turn orange).

Group selection results and formatting toolbar behavior (outside the map toolbar) remain unchanged.

Do not introduce zoom/pan on entering or exiting selection mode.

Acceptance Criteria

Clicking Select Group immediately lets the user draw a polygon (no toolbar appears).

Circle, edit/pencil, and trash buttons are gone.

Completing the polygon selects the correct properties and highlights them (icons + parcels) in orange.

Exit Selection stops drawing and exits selection mode; no zoom/pan occurs.

Works identically in original and expanded map states.

No dead imports/handlers left from the removed toolbar.

Summary Output

List of files/lines changed.

Confirmation that the toolbar code and its buttons were removed.

Confirmation that polygon mode auto-starts on Select Group in both map states and selection behaves as before (minus the toolbar).
