Feature: Add “Create Label” (draggable map note) from marker popup

Goal
- Add a new toolbar button on the marker popup: **Create Label**.
- When clicked, create a text label on the map near the selected marker.
- The label is **draggable** (user can move it on the map) and **persistent** across collapsed/expanded map states and page reloads.
- This is UI/front-end only. No backend/package.json changes.

Implementation details
- Add a new button to the popup toolbar alongside Icon / Color / Note: **Create Label**.
- On click:
  - Insert a new label object into a central store (reuse the project’s existing state/store pattern—same as markers).
  - Shape:
    ```
    {
      id: string,          // unique id
      text: string,        // default: "" (focus input immediately)
      lat: number,
      lng: number,
      color?: string,      // optional; default same as current theme foreground
      size?: "sm"|"md"|"lg" // optional
    }
    ```
  - Initial position = marker’s current coordinates (lat/lng).
  - Immediately render an input for the new label’s text (auto-focus). Placeholder: "Enter label..."
  - Save text on Enter and on blur. Keep the label visible as text after editing.
- Render:
  - Add a dedicated “labels layer” on top of the map (same component that renders markers).
  - Each label is an absolutely-positioned map overlay (using the map lib’s projection util already used for markers).
  - Draggable: user can drag the label; update its lat/lng as it moves.
  - Click or double-click on a label re-enters edit mode (to change text).
  - Provide a small “×” delete control on hover/focus to remove a label.
  - Ensure pointer events for dragging/editing don’t pan the map (use stopPropagation where needed).
- Persistence:
  - Store labels in the same central store as markers or a parallel `labels` collection.
  - Persist to `localStorage` on change and rehydrate on load.
  - When the map toggles collapsed/expanded (component remount), labels are restored and reprojected correctly.
- Accessibility/UX:
  - Keyboard: Enter to save, Esc to cancel edit (revert draft).
  - Focus ring on the editable input; aria-labels for “Create Label”, “Edit label”, “Delete label”.
- Styling:
  - Match dark theme: readable contrast, subtle shadow, small rounded chip for text.
  - z-index above markers so labels remain visible.
- Do not modify backend API or `package.json` scripts. Use ESM and existing conventions.

Deliverables
- Updated popup toolbar with **Create Label**.
- New label overlay system (render, edit, drag, delete).
- Labels persist across map toggle and reload (localStorage).
- Short summary of changed files and how to add/edit/move/delete a label.
