Goal
When the user completes a polygon (group selection), the app should leave drawing mode immediately so they can proceed (edit group, review results, etc.). Stay in selection mode; only the draw tool should be disabled.

Implementation

Locate the Leaflet-draw completion handler (the code listening for draw:created or equivalent).

If there isn’t a centralized handler, add one where the map instance is initialized (likely in property-map.tsx or the map wrapper).

The handler already computes selected geocodes and calls onPropertySelection(geocodes).

After calling onPropertySelection(...), disable the active draw tool so drawing mode ends:
// Exit drawing mode after polygon creation
if (drawPolygonRef?.current?.disable) {
  drawPolygonRef.current.disable();
}
drawPolygonRef.current = null;

If a different variable is used for the active drawing tool, apply the same .disable() + null logic to that variable.

If you enabled drawing via new L.Draw.Polygon(map, opts).enable(), keep a ref to that instance and disable it here.

Do not exit selection mode here. The user should still see/keep the selection and the group toolbar behavior should remain unchanged.

Both map states

Ensure this works in original and expanded map views. If each view creates its own map instance, add the same handler/disable logic for both.

No regressions

No zoom/pan changes.

Highlighting rules (orange icons + orange polygons) remain as-is.

Group formatting and “Exit Selection” continue to work.

Acceptance Criteria

After finishing a polygon, the cursor returns to normal (no more crosshair/vertex handles).

The selected properties remain highlighted and listed.

User can immediately click other UI (edit group, results list) without being stuck in draw mode.

Behavior is identical in original and expanded map states.

Summary Output

Files/lines changed.

Where the draw:created (or equivalent) handler lives now.

Confirmation that the draw tool is disabled after polygon completion and selection mode persists.
